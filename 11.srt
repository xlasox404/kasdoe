1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,130
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:05,279
I still feel like we're
rushing this.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,061
I'm not the one calling the shots.

4
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:10,232
Who are you?
– I'm Lyndon James. Nate doesn't exist.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,131
Mona has people watching their every move.

6
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:16,373
There's no way that she has
someone watching all of us.

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:17,828
We can put an end to this.

8
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:21,629
He's the father of my son.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,093
Yeah, he deserves to know that.

10
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:25,035
I need some time to sort this all out.

11
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,895
If he figures out that I'm lying to him...
– He won't.

12
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,026
Everything okay?

13
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,537
It's my powerhouse potion.

14
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,379
Aria knows that you saw Alison that night.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,581
I swear, I didn't hurt Alison.

16
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,428
Last chance to save yourself.

17
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:42,036
Yes, it is.

18
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,514
Is this what you're looking for?

19
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,754
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

20
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:50,763
Please tell me.

21
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,315
Spencer needs to talk to her sister.

22
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,633
Okay, but she needs to
talk to one of us first.

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,628
I've tried her, like, three
times with no answer.

24
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:17,953
Yeah. I haven't heard from her either,

25
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,124
and neither has Hanna.

26
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:21,292
I wonder if we should even tell her at all.

27
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:23,639
Do you remember when we thought
Melissa was torturing us?

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,493
Aria, your dad said that he saw Melissa

29
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,599
outside Ali's house the
night she was murdered.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,726
I don't think she was out
for an evening stroll.

31
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,189
She must know something.

32
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,388
I know, I just... think we should hold off.

33
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,080
I've gotta go. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

34
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,274
Come in.

35
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:43,041
Hey. I thought you were
coming back downstairs.

36
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,280
I have to work super early tomorrow.

37
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:47,028
What's that?

38
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:48,878
It's for you.

39
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:51,479
It came in this morning, but I wasn't sure

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,912
if I should give it to you or not.

41
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:54,884
Why? What is it?

42
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,864
James family...?

43
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,706
I don't know a James family in Chicago.

44
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,105
Wasn't that Nate's real name?

45
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:08,804
Look, honey, do you want me just to take it

46
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,465
down to the police station?
– No.

47
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,077
Really, 'cause I could just

48
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,585
have one of the police
officers open it for you.

49
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,753
Mom, you just started working there.

50
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,454
They're gonna ask you a
million questions about...

51
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:21,684
Me, about Maya, about Nate, and...

52
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,109
Why I ever trusted him.

53
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:26,437
Look, I never should have
brought this up here.

54
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:29,756
No, don't take it. I want to open it.

55
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,196
Why did he have these?

56
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,222
These are all things I gave to Ali.

57
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,481
Maya must have found them in Ali's house

58
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,600
and tried to give them back to me.

59
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,741
Look, sweetie, just put the
stuff away and come downstairs.

60
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:58,724
No, no, I'm fine. I...

61
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,240
I just hate the thought of
him touching any of this.

62
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,549
Why would they send this to me?

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,586
I guess they're just doing what they can.

64
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,560
You know, they couldn't undo
what their son did, so...

65
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,492
I should have just opened that myself.

66
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,208
Look, are you sure you don't
wanna just come downstairs?

67
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,431
Not tonight. I'm really tired.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,110
I should probably just go to bed.

69
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:28,854
All right.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,818
Why are you sitting in the dark?

71
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:03,812
I'm not.
– Your arm still bothering you?

72
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,460
Not so much.

73
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,161
How did you hurt yourself again?

74
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,856
It was stupid. I just slipped in gym.

75
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:13,392
Well, don't you think it's something
a doctor should take a look at?

76
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,118
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

77
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,214
I can type with one hand.

78
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:22,089
Well, clearly, you need two to wash a pot.

79
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,848
Typing is not scraping.

80
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:34,932
How's school going?

81
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:38,304
Is it still difficult
to see Mona every day?

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,454
We only have two classes together.

83
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:43,662
Two's a lot.

84
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,507
If it's distracting, I can
talk to Mr Tamborelli

85
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,227
and help you transfer...

86
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,050
Mom, she'd still be there.

87
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm not gonna avoid going
down every hallway.

88
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:54,778
I understand.

89
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,137
I-I'm just trying to protect...

90
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,928
Why do you think I need protection?

91
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:02,297
I meant... to protect your education.

92
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,341
Is there something else
I need to know about?

93
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,662
Is it happening again?

94
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,264
Hanna?
– No, there's nothing.

95
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:13,840
I just don't need anyone
else protecting me, okay?

96
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,718
One caped crusader is enough.

97
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:19,726
Who's wearing the cape? Caleb?

98
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,392
I have to take a shower.

99
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,774
Has Caleb been tangling with Mona?

100
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,367
"Tangling"?

101
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:29,826
I don't even know what that means.

102
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,083
Has Mona said anything to you recently,

103
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,867
or done something to make...?
– No.

104
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,095
He just doesn't trust her.

105
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,113
He thinks she should be watched.

106
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,703
You know, I-I think I am
gonna call Mr Tamborelli.

107
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,733
Don't. I can deal with Mona and Caleb.

108
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,932
Just... leave it alone.

109
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,856
I'm glad to hear that
you're getting her help.

110
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:57,123
Like I said, I just hope that
she makes a full recovery,

111
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,754
and I know that my daughter
feels the same way.

112
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,696
Thank you.

113
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,685
You too, Mr Sorenson.

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,495
Well, I just got off the phone
with Meredith's father.

115
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,362
Wow. That must have been weird.

116
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:21,922
Turns out Meredith has a long history of...

117
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:23,848
Issues.

118
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,911
He thinks that she stopped taking her meds,

119
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:31,157
and I told him that we didn't
want to see her punished,

120
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,956
we wanted to see her treated.

121
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,165
That is still what you want, right?

122
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,469
Yeah, but... can she be
treated in another state,

123
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,892
like... Alaska?

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,341
I won't let her anywhere near my family.

125
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,778
She never should have
been in the first place.

126
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,351
You know, when we first
moved into this house,

127
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,582
we didn't have money for a furnace,

128
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:17,524
and it was winter, so we
bundled you up in sweaters.

129
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,126
You looked like this...

130
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,568
Big ball of yarn,

131
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,373
rolling from room to room.

132
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,000
And we never used the fireplace,

133
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,114
'cause I was scared that
we'd turn our backs

134
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,145
and you'd get burned.

135
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:42,245
I knew that my one job on
this earth was to make sure

136
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:43,964
that you didn't get hurt.

137
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:52,559
And I haven't done a very good job...

138
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:54,765
Have I?

139
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,929
Still recovering?

140
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,352
From the anniversary dinner.

141
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,471
Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,902
Was he surprised?

143
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,914
Mm-hmm. It was a really big surprise.

144
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,334
Where were you last night?
Were you with Caleb?

145
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,611
No, he's being really weird.

146
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:22,927
Every time I try to make plans with him,

147
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,307
he says he's busy, but he won't
tell me what he's doing.

148
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,427
Why don't you just ask him? Be honest.

149
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:31,025
Wow. It's like the world's
fattest man giving dieting tips.

150
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,018
Hello! You're the one who's

151
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,826
sitting on a secret the
size of the "Natterhorn"!

152
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,129
Okay, if you're talking
about Fitz and the kid,

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,918
I'm gonna tell him today.

154
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,187
And the goal was never to keep it from him.

155
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,531
I-I'd wake up every morning with
the intention of telling him,

156
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:45,033
and then I'd go to sleep every night
feeling guilty that I didn't.

157
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,792
At least you have your afternoons free.

158
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,808
Nice bit of support, Hanna.

159
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,592
Oh, and by the way, it's "Matterhorn." Muh.

160
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,525
Aren't you the one that's
supposed to be correcting her?

161
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,358
What?

162
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:56,329
Hey, what's wrong with you?

163
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,069
Uh, nothing. We didn't really
get much of an anniversary

164
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,831
'cause Toby had to get up
early for work the next day.

165
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:03,753
That sucks.

166
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,423
Yeah, it does.

167
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:08,088
Listen, um, I'm gonna skip the brew today

168
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,197
'cause I have a lot of
reading to catch up on,

169
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:12,795
for English, so I'll
catch you guys at lunch.

170
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,886
Hey, Em.
– Hey.

171
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,237
So, can we see it?

172
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:22,938
The stuff from his family?

173
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,493
Look, if it's, like,

174
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,231
cards and stuff you wrote to Ali,

175
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,182
you don't have to show us. It's fine.

176
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,761
So, did Spencer tell you about
the key that I dropped?

177
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,115
No, Hanna did.

178
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,450
Said you guys want to
turn it in to the cops...?

179
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:41,289
So, what do you think?

180
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,041
I think that the mold from my basement

181
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,816
killed some of your brain cells.

182
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:47,562
Guys, we are not prepared
to tell the cops about A.

183
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,148
I guess you're right.

184
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,469
Mnh. I always hated biology.

185
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,180
Who cares how a cell divides? It just does.

186
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,271
I didn't know that you and
Ali were in bio together.

187
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:57,280
We weren't.

188
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,688
I lent her my notes to study for the exam.

189
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,052
Then how'd you have the
time to write these?

190
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,548
This is definitely Alison's handwriting.

191
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,267
Yeah, but that's not mine.

192
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,575
Wait. Who's "the beach hottie"?

193
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:13,518
What?

194
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,003
"You need to tell the
beach hottie tonight."

195
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,557
Then Ali says, "no way, he'll freak out."

196
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:18,473
What are they talking about?

197
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,840
I want to know who they're talking about.
Turn the page.

198
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:23,526
That's not Spencer's writing, either.

199
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:24,544
But I recognise it.

200
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:25,754
Who does their "G"s like that?

201
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:26,998
My grandma.

202
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,888
Forget the "G". Look at the "T".

203
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,515
There's someone in here that we do know.

204
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,996
Why is Alison writing about Toby?

205
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:47,671
If you'll be home I around two P.M.

206
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,167
I've got a free period after lunch

207
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:53,062
and wanted to stop by so we could talk.

208
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,875
Uh, call me. Love you.

209
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,433
Just go now. Meet him there.

210
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,128
Sooner you do it, the better you'll feel.

211
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,720
Just don't know what else it's gonna take.

212
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,771
You stuck a wet brain in her locker.

213
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:15,634
She still showed up the next
day with a smile on her face.

214
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,909
Fine. I'll figure it out.

215
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,017
Caleb, I just said I'll do it.

216
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,682
I'll be there around seven.

217
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,037
It's off Route 6. I know it.

218
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,209
Hey. I been looking for you.

219
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,512
Did you get my text?

220
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,006
Uh, yeah.

221
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,716
Yeah, you said that you found some of.

222
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,553
Ali's writing in an old notebook?

223
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,751
It's an entire conversation
between Ali and a friend,

224
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:49,318
but none of us recognise
the friend's handwriting.

225
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,533
Sorry.

226
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,701
I have to get to class.
– You don't get it.

227
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,924
Ali wasn't sharing makeup
tips with this person.

228
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,906
They were talking about a guy that
Ali was secretly involved with.

229
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,617
They call him the beach hottie.

230
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,739
Was Ian ever a lifeguard?

231
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,547
I don't know, but Melissa might. Okay?

232
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:11,746
Sorry, em, I've really got to get to class.

233
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:13,137
Spencer...

234
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:15,484
Ali was scared of this guy,

235
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:17,136
or at least scared to tell him something.

236
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,936
Okay, well, good luck figuring it out.

237
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:20,342
What?! Maybe she was just scared

238
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:21,925
to tell him that she was slutting it up

239
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,181
in three different zip codes in one summer.

240
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,221
What are you saying?

241
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm saying that Ali wasn't loyal.

242
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,538
To any of us.

243
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,160
So why do we continue to be loyal to her?

244
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,090
I mean, why should we
care what happens to her?

245
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,173
What happened to her?

246
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,192
Because we do.

247
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:40,624
Care.

248
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,045
I think that I need to learn to stop.

249
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:48,055
Wait.

250
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:49,603
Read.

251
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:06,544
Alison visited Toby after
he was shipped off to juvie.

252
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:19,027
What is this?
– You know exactly what it is.

253
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:21,016
It's time to quit the pen pal routine.

254
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:21,740
What?

255
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,627
Clearly your time in cellblock four

256
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:26,376
has done great things for
your literary skills,

257
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:28,135
but this needs to stop.

258
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:34,768
I didn't write these.

259
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,063
Listen.

260
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:39,915
I drove all the way up here

261
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,799
and just got a triple-x
pat down by security.

262
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,609
The least you can do is save me
the trouble of being lied to.

263
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,016
Why are you so convinced that it's me?

264
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,855
Pretty sure Jenna would love
to see your head on a stick.

265
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,070
Jenna would be pretty happy
to see anything, I imagine.

266
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,721
Your step-sis was going through surgery

267
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,592
when some of these were sent.

268
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:01,032
You wanna know how it turned out?

269
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:04,922
She's still combing her hair
with an electric toothbrush.

270
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:07,566
You can go now.

271
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,000
You know, I wasn't the only
one outside that garage.

272
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,531
Why aren't you harassing my friends?

273
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,681
You know what?

274
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,711
I wish I knew who wrote those notes.

275
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,654
I'd offer my services.

276
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,634
You and your posse deserve a lot worse.

277
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,149
I bet you wish you'd kissed
me when you had the chance.

278
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:42,504
You okay?

279
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,794
Spence, what's wrong?

280
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:51,347
You're not upset because Ali tried
to hook up with Toby, are you?

281
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,097
Who even knows if she did?

282
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,048
Just because she wrote
it down doesn't mean...

283
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,996
I-I haven't told you guys the truth.

284
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,624
What do you mean? What truth?

285
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,059
That Toby and I broke up

286
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,992
last night.

287
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,571
You did?

288
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:11,706
What happened?

289
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,141
I'm not really ready to talk about it.

290
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,299
Can we... please just keep it between us?

291
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,260
Yeah.

292
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,346
Thanks.

293
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,006
It's just not that simple.

294
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,857
I mean, she became part of a group.

295
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,173
They influenced her.

296
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,125
I think she just called
him out to punish him.

297
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,069
Well, maybe at first, sure,

298
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,491
but I think she really started
to believe in her own lie.

299
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:54,694
Spencer.

300
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:56,879
Are you all right?

301
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,087
Spencer.
– I need to go!

302
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,358
Go where?
– Home.

303
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,761
Is something wrong?

304
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:05,143
Do you want me to call your mom?
– For what?

305
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:06,863
You can't just storm out

306
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:09,215
of the classroom without
a legitimate excuse.

307
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,547
I don't want to be here anymore.

308
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,083
Is that legitimate enough?

309
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,462
What is going on with you?

310
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:14,699
I don't need to sit in a room

311
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,728
and read books about made-up
people who've been screwed over.

312
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:19,086
Okay, I get it.

313
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,730
It's not gonna prepare me for
what I have to deal with

314
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:21,994
when I walk out of this building.

315
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,201
It is a complete waste of my time!

316
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,518
Hey.

317
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,511
Enjoying a nice day in the park?

318
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,653
Oh. Spencer. I didn't even see you, uh...

319
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,532
Been writing down all of
your thoughts and feelings?

320
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,726
Um... actually, I was
working on this, um...

321
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,149
How could you do that to her?

322
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:53,295
I'm sorry, I-I-I...

323
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:55,158
No, don't apologise to me.

324
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,852
My God, not after the way
that you've treated her.

325
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:01,021
Do you even get how much she loves you?

326
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:03,153
Do you think that it's easy to
find out a secret like that?

327
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,907
Because it's not, okay? It's a burden.

328
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:06,627
I mean, you're screwed

329
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,268
if you tell and you're
screwed if you don't,

330
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:11,153
and if you really want to get
pissed and take it out on somebody,

331
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,701
don't dump it on Aria, okay?

332
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,681
No, go after Maggie, because she's actually

333
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:15,767
the person who had your son

334
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,454
and then kept it a secret for seven years!

335
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,946
What are you talking about?

336
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:27,737
I thought... I thought, um...

337
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:31,922
I thought that Aria had told you, and...

338
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,889
Did you not have this conversation?

339
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,853
What... conversation?

340
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:40,388
What... what are you talking about?

341
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,584
I need to... I need to go.

342
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,010
No, Spencer, wait.

343
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,149
Oh. Thank you.
– No problem.

344
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,306
How's the family?

345
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:06,898
Mm, everyone's good, you know?

346
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,195
My husband's back in Texas
on base, in training,

347
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,858
and Emily's...

348
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,364
You know, she's okay.

349
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:15,825
Good.

350
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:17,535
Hey, can I ask you something?

351
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:20,577
Emily got a package yesterday

352
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:24,839
from the family of the kid
who killed Maya St Germain.

353
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:27,903
Should I be worried that
they have our address?

354
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:29,822
They shouldn't be contacting you at all.

355
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,322
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

356
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:36,618
No, please. This kind of thing's
much more his territory than mine.

357
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,869
If you want, we can ask that his family

358
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,516
send any future correspondence
directly to us,

359
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,258
let us run interference.

360
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,250
Thanks. I'll think about that.

361
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,780
Hey, you seen Spencer?

362
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:29,332
Mmm, no, not since this morning.

363
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,097
Everyone said she bailed
on her study group.

364
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,657
She just walked out of class.

365
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,677
Hey.
– Hey.

366
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:48,717
Hey, what are you doing here?

367
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,236
Could I see you for a moment?

368
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,441
Sure, what's going on. Is everything okay?

369
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:54,230
Okay?

370
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,472
I don't know. You tell me.

371
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,139
Why was Spencer talking about Maggie?

372
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,092
What?

373
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,240
She said that I had...

374
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,914
That I have a son.

375
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,229
Why would she say that?

376
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:09,129
Look, can we just talk about this...

377
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,199
We're talking about this right now.
– Ezra, please.

378
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:26,462
Y-you've been holding onto
this since my birthday?

379
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:27,800
Ezra...
– So, what, you and my brother...

380
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,542
Just sat there watching
me blow out candles,

381
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:31,500
and you couldn't find a
way to tell me this?

382
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,524
I was scared.

383
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,437
Of?
– Of what it might do to us.

384
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,658
And then Maggie showed up,
and I thought that she

385
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,171
was going to tell you,
and when she didn't...

386
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,881
Maggie hasn't been a part of
my life since high school.

387
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,831
I see you every day, Aria. You.

388
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:46,669
You are the person I'm
spending my life with.

389
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,110
You are the person I'm supposed to trust.

390
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,393
You're right.

391
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,290
Thought you needed a little push,
so I pushed "send" for you. – A

392
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:35,251
You know, the only thing worse than the
break room coffee are the break room bagels.

393
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:40,545
How's Emily feel about you working here?

394
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:41,955
How should she feel?

395
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,210
I was hoping it'd make
her feel a little safer.

396
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,808
You know, when I was growing up here,
they could have put up a sign:

397
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,409
"Welcome to Rosewood,
where nothing happens."

398
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:54,589
But in these past few years...

399
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,387
Detective Wilden, if you're asking
if we're considering moving...

400
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,273
I wouldn't blame you.

401
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,909
There are days when I
wish I could leave too.

402
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,006
But no matter how far I went,

403
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,727
I'd still be taking so
many questions with me.

404
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:11,510
You know, you may not believe this,

405
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:13,475
but I know exactly what
Emily's going through.

406
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm not following you.

407
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,579
What happened out at that lighthouse,

408
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:21,342
it's not really something any
young person can process.

409
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,946
Even when it's self-defence.

410
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:26,951
But uh...

411
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,660
It haunts you. Forever.

412
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,265
I can't really get her
to talk about it much.

413
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:37,602
Well, I didn't either.

414
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,661
Talk about it.

415
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,225
My second week out of the academy,

416
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:44,708
I had to defend myself.

417
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:46,374
The way they taught me.

418
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:49,858
But that doesn't make watching
someone die any easier.

419
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,734
I was too ashamed to discuss it.

420
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,054
In the law's eyes, I was
clearly in the right.

421
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,230
But having to watch
someone leave this world,

422
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,192
even someone who deserves to be punished...

423
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,252
So when did you finally decide
to start talking about it?

424
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:13,819
Just now.

425
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:47,026
Hey.

426
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:48,731
Hey.

427
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,812
Tried calling you.

428
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,898
Sorry, I shut my phone off.

429
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:58,380
Yeah, well, you didn't
come back today to school.

430
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,694
My mom said she might call your parents.
– I figured.

431
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:03,704
I don't think she wants to. I just think...

432
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,952
Whatever. It's okay. I
won't hold it against her.

433
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:10,950
Anyway, it's not really why you came.

434
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:12,676
Well...

435
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,281
No.

436
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:17,565
I wanted to talk to you...

437
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,795
I know that I shouldn't
have said anything to Fitz.

438
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:21,144
Okay, I know that.

439
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,444
So, can we please just
skip ahead to the end?

440
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:26,484
Sorry?

441
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,495
Could we just fast-forward to the part

442
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,268
where you scream or you cry

443
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,472
or just do whatever you need to do, okay?

444
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,176
Wait, I-I didn't come here
to punish you, Spencer.

445
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,476
I know that you were set up.

446
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:40,580
A sent me a text to rub it in
my face right after Ezra left.

447
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,729
I think that we should stop blaming A

448
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,397
for everything that goes
wrong in our lives,

449
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:46,196
and start blaming ourselves.

450
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:51,259
Whoa. Are you actually
defending our enemy right now?

451
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,899
No, I'm just saying that maybe
if we stopped telling lies,

452
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,286
maybe A wouldn't have a reason
to keep on exposing them.

453
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,059
A isn't some tough-love
life coach, Spencer.

454
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:01,474
We're not being taught to mind
our manners and eat our vegetables.

455
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,859
This person wants to hurt us.

456
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:04,468
Maybe we deserve it.

457
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,888
Unbelievable.

458
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,330
And thanks for your concern, by the way.

459
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:14,253
I'm... I'm doing just fine.

460
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,540
Wow. This is crazy.

461
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:28,594
I totally remember this.

462
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,857
We were stuck in the car
with Ali's parents,

463
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,461
two hours from shore, and
our phones were dead.

464
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:34,307
It was brutal.

465
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,036
So... who was the "beach hottie"?

466
00:26:39,037 --> 00:26:40,323
Mm, I have no idea.

467
00:26:41,095 --> 00:26:42,489
But you were writing about him.

468
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,016
I just knew him by that name.

469
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:45,973
Ali never told me who he was.

470
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,997
So you never even met him?

471
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,756
Well, I mean, I probably did.

472
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,504
Honestly, there were so many
hotties down there that summer.

473
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,477
But Ali was being really sketchy about it.

474
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,785
I just assumed he was
seeing her on the side.

475
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,533
He probably had a girlfriend or something.

476
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,273
Would Jason know this person?

477
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:05,308
If he did, he would have made him sorry

478
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,864
he ever looked at his little sister.

479
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:08,131
Why?

480
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,051
Will somebody call Jason and
tell him to leave his weed

481
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:19,485
and come meet up with us.

482
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,348
What are you doing here?

483
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:31,806
I needed to talk to you.

484
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:32,973
What's wrong?

485
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,700
I think I'm in trouble.

486
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:37,361
What do you mean?

487
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:39,852
I'm late.

488
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,285
Like...?

489
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,179
Yeah.

490
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,520
You mean you weren't using protection?

491
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,125
We were. Just not all the time.

492
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,157
Okay, how late are you?

493
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,406
Two weeks.

494
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:52,961
Have you ever been late before?

495
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,122
What am I gonna do?

496
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:01,710
Have you told him?

497
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,013
I can't.

498
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,731
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.

499
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:15,948
Ali was...

500
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:18,972
Listen, I'm not a doctor, Em,

501
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,433
but... she thought that she was.

502
00:28:22,197 --> 00:28:24,728
It's like I said... it was
an intense couple of weeks.

503
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,515
Hey. What are you doing?

504
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,659
Right now? Following Paige.
– What?

505
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,270
She's the one who's been working
with Caleb to bring down Mona.

506
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,812
I'm trying to bust them before A does.

507
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,256
Wait, when did you find this out?

508
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:54,249
Before lunch.

509
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,429
I was gonna tell you, but Ezra...

510
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,398
Right.

511
00:28:58,646 --> 00:28:59,778
Hanna, be careful.

512
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,562
I-I gotta go. I'll call you later.

513
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:02,296
Bye.

514
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,425
Bye.

515
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:40,813
What is this?

516
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:42,483
Raspberry flirtini.

517
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,744
Thank you, but I didn't order this.

518
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,325
I know. She ordered it for you.

519
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,355
Hey.

520
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,240
Hey.

521
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,035
You've been on that couch a while.

522
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,888
How 'bout I make my fancy grilled cheese?

523
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:31,292
Yeah.

524
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:45,718
If she were pregnant,

525
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,997
wouldn't that kind of
thing show up on her...

526
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,031
Autopsy?

527
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:50,457
Not necessarily.

528
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:52,384
I looked online, and...

529
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,141
If it was really early on,

530
00:31:56,477 --> 00:32:00,163
she was buried over a year ago, so...

531
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:04,941
What shall we do now?

532
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:06,823
I don't know.

533
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,483
But look, if some guy in cape
may did get her pregnant

534
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:12,515
and then threatened to
kill her if he found out,

535
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,279
this is a lot bigger than a key.

536
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,007
This needs to be turned over to the police.

537
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,017
I was worried you were gonna say that.

538
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,656
But I agree.

539
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,263
I'll take you down to the station.

540
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,329
Then I'm coming with you.

541
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,549
No, that's okay. I won't be alone.

542
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,536
My mom will be there.

543
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,112
I'll call you later.

544
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:31,419
Okay.

545
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,181
I miss you.

546
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,201
And if they play the uncut version of this,

547
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:47,202
then I'd have to kiss you.

548
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,609
Hey, ladies, shots are a dollar

549
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,437
if you holler in the next half hour,

550
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:54,158
so step up and get 'em while
they're hot, hot, hot!

551
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:05,603
Hi. I hope you don't mind. I
just really love this song.

552
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,742
Who is this peroxide piece of trash?

553
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:22,845
Hey, watch it!

554
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,119
Can I see your ID?

555
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,061
Why would the police want this?

556
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:40,963
I don't know. Um, Ali wrote in it.

557
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:43,019
Maybe there's something in there
that could help them figure out

558
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,561
who would want to hurt her.

559
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:47,971
Okay, let me find out who to give this to.

560
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:20,694
Hanna?

561
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,491
Hi.
– What are you doing here?

562
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,417
What's that smell? Is that... Tequila?

563
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,308
No. It's actually gin.

564
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,818
A little bit got in my mouth

565
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,088
when, uh, the girl threw
it in my face, so...

566
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,650
Who did? What happened?

567
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,647
Nothing. I just...

568
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,523
I got busted for underage drinking,

569
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,119
which I wasn't even doing.

570
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,576
Unfortunately, "I'm just holding it"

571
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,368
doesn't work on Betty the bouncer.

572
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,387
You were at a club.

573
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:49,501
More of a bar.
– What bar?

574
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:50,858
Oh, it was more of a club.

575
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,294
You wouldn't have heard of it.

576
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:55,500
My mom's gonna kill me.

577
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,209
Hey, Emily. Hanna.

578
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:01,869
I just spoke with your mom.

579
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,370
She said you wanted to turn something in?

580
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,719
What are you doing? The
cops need to see that.

581
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,560
Unfortunately, he's one of 'em.

582
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,458
I appreciate you bringing this down.

583
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,413
We'll return it to you as soon as we can.

584
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,199
Oh, and Emily,

585
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,451
you did the right thing.

586
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,723
What are you thinking?

587
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:25,586
I'm thinking we could end this.

588
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,033
I'm gonna get a coffee. Do you want one?

589
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,026
No thanks.

590
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:32,460
I'll take a napkin, for blotting.

591
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,408
What's wrong?

592
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,205
Look who else was in cape may.

593
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,985
I didn't know if you
were really gonna show.

594
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,840
Why wouldn't I?

595
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:19,465
Said you were 18, right?

596
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:24,235
So...

597
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,927
How does this work?

598
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:29,649
Well...

599
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:33,840
This works...

600
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:36,022
Whichever way you want it to work.

601
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:38,216
You called me.

602
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,550
I'm sensing some hesitation here.

603
00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:58,138
What does this go to?

604
00:37:58,449 --> 00:37:59,984
That's what I would like you to find out.

605
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,838
And if you follow him...

606
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:08,315
He'll lead you there.

607
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:11,035
Wait.

608
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,796
I'll be in touch.

609
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:48,532
Hold it.

610
00:38:49,692 --> 00:38:51,284
Can I at least shower first?

611
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,292
My hair is about to crack off my head.

612
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,268
I'm not going to bed
without discussing this.

613
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:57,349
What were you doing in that bar?
– Mom.

614
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,632
Was it about... exploring a new feeling?

615
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,403
Okay, I wasn't looking for romance.
I was looking for Caleb.

616
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,562
What would Caleb be doing
hanging out in a lesbian bar?

617
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:08,724
I didn't know it was ladies'
night until I got there.

618
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,364
Look, I was following Paige

619
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:11,558
because I thought he was
meeting up with her.

620
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,315
For what?

621
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,574
A plan to keep Mona away from my friends.

622
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:16,779
He and Paige don't want her near us,

623
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,450
so I was just gonna stop them
from doing anything stupid.

624
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:22,156
And that required ordering a
cocktail and starting a bar fight?

625
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:23,661
I did not order a cocktail,

626
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:24,779
and I only danced with

627
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,416
that girl who thought I
was into pink drinks

628
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,166
because I didn't want Paige to see me.

629
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:30,171
What's a pink drink?

630
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,508
Is that code for something gay?

631
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:34,138
No, it's just a pink drink.

632
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,524
Can we not do this right now?

633
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,863
Hanna, we're getting to that place again.

634
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:39,733
What place?

635
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:42,388
Where I'm sensing you're not
telling me the whole truth.

636
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,419
Well, I'm not hiding
anything from you, okay?

637
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:47,326
I was just making sure Caleb
didn't get into trouble.

638
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:49,198
And you got yourself into trouble instead.

639
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,235
Well, that wasn't the plan.

640
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,359
And, honestly, if it keeps
Emily from being messed with,

641
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,764
maybe it was worth it.

642
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,797
What does Emily have to do with this?

643
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,229
Paige might not be a one-girl kind of girl.

644
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,260
She was hooking up with someone
there, and Emily has no clue.

645
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,289
Could I make a suggestion?

646
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,012
Stay out of it.

647
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,083
And use the hot oil treatment on your hair.

648
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,323
Hey.

649
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,457
I was just...

650
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,208
I thought that we were meeting
up at your apartment.

651
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:39,475
No, we are. Uh...

652
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:41,719
I was just putting a few things in the car.

653
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:43,737
Can I just explain to you why...

654
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:45,135
I don't need you to explain.

655
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,314
I spoke with Maggie, and she told me

656
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:49,659
that she asked you to keep quiet.

657
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,438
And... she knows it was an
unfair position to put you in.

658
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:57,759
So are we okay?

659
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:00,329
Yeah.

660
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:04,284
Are you okay?

661
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,519
I don't even know how to begin

662
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,786
to answer that question.

663
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,395
Yeah. I understand.
– Good.

664
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:12,849
Because I don't.

665
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:17,187
There are, like, a million thoughts

666
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:19,865
fighting in my head right now, and...

667
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,664
I'm about to meet my son.

668
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,656
But you're leaving?

669
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,853
Yeah, tonight.
– How long?

670
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:34,973
Uh, I don't know.

671
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:42,362
Well, where are you staying tonight?

672
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:44,402
Motel.

673
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,470
I got a college buddy in the area

674
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,467
that I can stay with tomorrow night.

675
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,382
That's good.

676
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,133
Yep.

677
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:55,316
Can I call you?

678
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:00,023
Ezra?

679
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:12,946
Ezra?

680
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:17,980
We'll talk soon, okay?
